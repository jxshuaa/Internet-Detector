<p>This code checks whether your computer is connected to the internet by attempting to connect to a website (in this case, Github) using the <code>requests</code> library in Python. If the connection is successful, it prints "Internet check" and waits for 0.4 seconds before moving on to the rest of the code. If there is a <code>ConnectionError</code>, it means the computer is not connected to the internet, so it prompts the user to check their connection and exits the program.</p>
